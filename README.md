Audio test tool for iOS
===============================

## Overview
You can measure audio performance on your iPhone/iPad with this tool.
To get a score, tap "Start measurement".
The score decreases if there is a problem whithin 60 seconds.

## Background
I noticed that my iPhone XS sounds noisy when I tests my synthesizer apps.
So I created this tool to measure my device's audio performance.
